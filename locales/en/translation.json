    "DESCRIPTION": "Who knows where the loop babies came from? No one knows what they want or where they live, only that they show up every once in a while with a loop station and start playing the tunes of pop songs and classic tunes alike. Thereâ€™s baby Claire and Cavin on vocals, and baby Terry on instrumentals. Together they form a band of incredible versatility and unexpected cuteness. Like any other baby, they demand lots of attention and care, so they would be very happy if you would come out and show them some love. They also like cookies."
